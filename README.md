Angular Inline Scroll Demo
This demo was created to showcase the abilities of Eddie Prislac, polyglot code warrior and UI/UX designer. It makes use of Angular, Bootstrap, angular-whenScrolled, TypeKit, FontAwesome, and moment.js. The demo below loads lazy-loads json news items, five-at-a-time, as you scroll down. The items are from the feed at http://www.stellarbiotechnologies.com/media/press-releases/json.
